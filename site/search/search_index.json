You can find more information about winPEAS and download either the precompiled executable or a .bat script. WinPEAS will run commands similar to the ones listed in the previous task and print their output. The output from winPEAS can be lengthy and sometimes difficult to read. This is why it would be good practice to always redirect the output to a file, as shown below:</p> <p>Command Prompt</p> <pre><code>       `C:\\&gt; winpeas.exe &gt; outputfile.txt`\n</code></pre> <p>WinPEAS can be downloaded here.  </p>"},{"location":"Tools%20for%20winprivesc/#privesccheck","title":"PrivescCheck","text":"<p>PrivescCheck is a PowerShell script that searches common privilege escalation on the target system.
