- Network design and architecture
- Routing and switching
- Wireless networking
- Network troubleshooting


## <span style="color:#9f00ff">Hobbies</span>

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for sports. Playing sports like basketball and football is one of my favorite hobbies. Engaging in sports not only keeps me physically active but also teaches me valuable lessons about teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.
